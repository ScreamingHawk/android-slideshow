## Description
Now you can view files on your devices with ease!!!

Quickly browse through your file system for the directory you want to view, click an image and the slideshow will automatically begin.

Awesome for showing off those vacation photos without having to scroll.

## Controls

There are a couple hidden controls when using a slideshow. 

**Swipe left / right** to change to next / previous image.

**Single tap** to start / stop the slideshow.
