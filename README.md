## Description
Now you can view files on your devices with ease!

Quickly browse through your file system for the directory you want to view, click an image and the slideshow will automatically begin.

Great for showing off those vacation photos without having to scroll.

## Controls

There are a couple hidden controls when using a slideshow. 

**Swipe left / right** to change to next / previous image.

**Single tap** to start / stop the slideshow.

**Long press during the slideshow** to disable user input. This is handy when you don't want grandma to accidentally stop the slideshow when she is dusting the device. 

**Double tap** to pause the slideshow without showing the details panel.
